// audio_levels.h — how loud the sound is, taken where it leaves the box.
//
// The meter is tapped at the point the samples are handed to the sound card,
// not at the point they arrive from the network. That is the whole design of
// this header and it is worth saying why, because the obvious place to put a
// meter — on the decoded feed — answers a different question.
//
// On this box the sound leaves through a card the AES67 daemon reads, so "is
// there audio?" is not a property of the event, it is a property of what the
// card was given. A muted box, a card that failed to open, and a feed that has
// genuinely gone quiet all look identical on a meter of the feed, and they are
// three completely different things to an operator at eleven o'clock at night.
// So the bars fall to silence when the card is closed or the sound is muted,
// because that is what the card is being given, and they are accompanied by
// words saying which of the reasons it is.
//
// The arithmetic is the part that can be quietly wrong — a peak that misses the
// negative half of a waveform, a NaN from a bad decode read as full scale, a
// channel counted twice — and it lives in a header with no ALSA in it, so it
// runs anywhere, including a laptop where alsa_output.cpp is not compiled at
// all. `tests/test_audio_levels.cpp` checks it.
