// test_audio_levels.cpp — the meter tapped where the sound leaves the box.
//
// A meter is arithmetic with a lot of ways to be quietly wrong: a peak that
// misses the negative half of a waveform, a channel that lands one slot over,
// a NaN from a corrupt decode read as full scale, a window that never closes so
// the bars never fall, a hold long enough that letting go of a loud moment is
// invisible. None of that needs a sound card to check, and the meter is written
// in a header with no ALSA in it precisely so this runs everywhere —
// alsa_output.cpp is compiled only where ALSA exists, so a test that needed the
// hardware would not run on the laptop where the interface was written.
